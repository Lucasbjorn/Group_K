## Group_K
This is our research project.

### Preliminary Research Question:
Can we increase the effectiveness of astrocytes in CA1 neurons to stop the cells undergoing apoptosis as a result of glutamate-induced excitotoxicity associated with stroke?

### Model: [ CA1 Cutsuridis](https://github.com/risecourse/CA1_Cutsuridis)
This is a neural circuit model, originally based in HOC and Neuron. Dr. Bezaire is adapting the code to Python 3.

### Description of Research Process
We plan on adapting the neural circuit model and changing around different variables to see if we can model the function of astrocytes on glutamate in synapses specifically. We want to add code for a threshold of glutamate in the synapse before the post synaptic cell dies. We want to record the firing patterns of neurons in the circuit to see if by simulating the affect of astroctyes, we can regulate the rate at which neurons fire even during a stroke.

### Extra
If we have time, we want to explore astrocyte function in more depth.
Can we start making changes without the completely updated version of code?
