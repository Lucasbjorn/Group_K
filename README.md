# BahlSynapsesPy

This is a model of a single pyramidal cell with realistic morphology and ion channels.

It has been modified to specify either an input from an electrode or synaptic inputs.

It will simulate the cell's response to the inputs and record the membrane potential at the soma and in the cell dendrites. Then it will save a picture of a plot of the membrane potential with time.
