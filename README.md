## Group_K
This is our research project.

### Preliminary Research Question:
Can we manipulate parameters of a post-synaptic neuron to keep the neuron alive even during glutamate exicitotoxicity that is caused by a stroke?

### Model: [ CA1 Cutsuridis](https://github.com/risecourse/CA1_Cutsuridis)
This is a neural circuit model, originally based in HOC and Neuron. Dr. Bezaire is adapting the code to Python 3.
Update: we are most likely planning on using a single neuron model.

### Description of Research Process
We want to use a model of a single neuron to simulate the process of a stroke. In simulating this, we would simulate changes in glutamate concentration to levels that could cause excitotoxicity and change the behavior and structure of other characteristics of the neuron to see if we could prevent cell death even in this condition. Our model would potentially record characteristics such as resting membrane potential, firing rates (including a threshold that would dictate cell death). This model would help identify possibel targets for therapy in the future to avoid cell death due to glutamate excitotoxicity that occurs during a stroke.

### Extra
If we have time, we want to explore astrocyte function in more depth.
Can we start making changes without the completely updated version of code?
