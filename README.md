### Preliminary Research Question:
Can we manipulate parameters of a neuron to keep the neuron functioning during simulated ATP deprivationthat is caused by a stroke?

### Model:  BahlSynapsesPy
This is a model of a single pyramidal cell with realistic morphology and ion channels.

It has been modified to specify either an input from an electrode or synaptic inputs.

It will simulate the cell's response to the inputs and record the membrane potential at the soma and in the cell dendrites. Then it will save a picture of a plot of the membrane potential with time.

### Description of Research Process
We want to use a model of a single neuron to simulate the process of a stroke. In simulating this, we would simulate changes in reversal potential of leak channels to levels that make the resting membrane potential higher and change the behavior and structure of other characteristics of the neuron to see if we preserve regular firing even in this condition. Our model would potentially record characteristics such as resting membrane potential and spike times. This model would help identify possible targets for therapy in the future to avoid causing glutamate excitotoxicity that occurs during a stroke.
