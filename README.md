This is our research project.

### Preliminary Research Question:
Can we increase the effectiveness of astrocytes in CA1 neurons to stop the cells from undergoing apoptosis as a result of glutamate-induced excitotoxicity associated with stroke?

### Model: [ CA1 Cutsuridis](https://github.com/risecourse/CA1_Cutsuridis)
This is a neural circuit model, originally based in HOC and Neuron. Dr. Bezaire is adapting the code to Python 3.
